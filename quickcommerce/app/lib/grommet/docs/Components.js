          Grommet components let you create attractive, reusable user
          interface elements allowing you to construct your experience 
          with ease.

          Grommet components greatly simplify the task of creating clear,
          well-designed, responsive experiences. All components are 
          accessible, cross-browser compatible and support theme 
          customization. Component flexibility is enhanced through 
          configuration through properties.

          For convenience of discovery, components are grouped by usage 
          classification. Each group is described below, each component 
          is listed by group to the left.

          <dd>
            Layout components are the primary methods Grommet uses to 
            structure content. Each of these elements can be considered 
            the scaffolding or bones of much of the Grommet design. 
          </dd>

          <dd>
            Structural components provide page elements for easy reuse 
            in your experience. These components are comprised of various 
            interface elements to make it easier to design common experience 
            scenarios. 
          </dd>
          <dt>Text</dt>
          <dd>
            Text components provide a variety of ways to manipulate the 
            content of your experience. Remember, when using Headings, be 
            semantic! You tell your story with text, so ensure itâ€™s easy to 
            follow!
          </dd>
          <dt>Controls</dt>
          <dd>
            Controls are components that promote interaction with your 
            experience. Each of these elements provides a method of 
            interaction to help users complete their tasks.
          </dd>
          <dt>Forms</dt>
          <dd>
            The Form components provide users with a variety of data input 
            methods (text-based, time-based, numeric, formatted content or 
            queries) to help enhance their experience. 
          </dd>
          <dt>Listing</dt>
          <dd>
            Listing components include Lists, Tables, and Tiles and are 
            useful for displaying a  collection of related items. All three 
            support item selection and responsive layout.`
          </dd>
          <dt>Visualization</dt>
          <dd>
            Visualization components provide a visual representation of data 
            for clear and efficient information communication. Numerical data 
            can be encoded as lines, bars or simple meters to visually 
            communicate quantitative messages. 
          </dd>
          <dt>Icons</dt>
          <dd>
            A large and growing collection of icons is provided for clear and 
            efficent language-independent communication. All icons are 
            vector-based for precise rendering in various sizes. Industry 
            standard glyphs are used where appropriate. 
          </dd>
          <dt>Media</dt>
          <dd>
            Photo and Video media are supported through the Carousel, Image, 
            and Video components.

            The Animate component provides simple enter/leave visibility 
            animation. Other utility components assist REST communication, 
            search and filter, and accessibility.
