        <Section>
          <Paragraph size="large">
            Grommet came to the world from four individuals inside
            Hewlett Packard that wanted to make designing a modern
            web experience for enterprise companies (or anyone really)
            easy. Working day to day, the designer and developer
            hand off is always a point of contention when it
            comes to our productivity and ensuring a
            unique vision is delivered to
            customers—So that’s where we started.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph size="medium">
            Our team used years of design and development experience
            to form Grommet. Taking the knowledge from various
            web technologies and customer focused experiences,
            we ventured out to the community to bootstrap with
            the best tools out there. Initially using
            Facebook’s React.js, Node.js, and Inuit as the
            underlying technologies, and layering on a
            visual design system and with some secret sauce to
            tie it all together. This provided the
            flexibility needed to create a dynamic library of components and
            allow Grommet to be one of the leading React UI
            Framework out there (horn toot).
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph size="medium">
            We originally created Grommet to be a solution
            for our own organization’s needs. We quickly
            found the usefulness for a tool like this outside
            Hewlett Packard, and taking a note from our own
            founders, Dave and Bill, we shared it with the
            open source community with great response. As
            with any company, change is inevitabe,
            and change it did…Hewlett Packard became
            two companies. The split became proof that
            Grommet was not only a valuable tool
            to the community, but to our own ecosystem.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph size="medium">
            Our goal is to continually enhance our
            toolset and make better experiences easier to create.
