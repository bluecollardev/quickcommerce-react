          Grommet makes heavy use of the <a
          href='https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/'>
          HTML5 Flexible Box Layout Module</a>. For this reason, Grommet
          requires
          a modern browser to ensure users have a good experience.  You can
          check the <a href='http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox'>

          A common question we receive is why are older versions of
          Microsoft Internet Explorer not supported.
          On January 12, 2016, <a
          href={"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/" +
            "End-of-IE-support"}>
          Microsoft ended support</a> for versions of Internet Explorer
          older than version 11.
          In order to deliver a secure and modern experience for the
          enterprise, Grommet does not provide
          support for browsers that are no longer receiving security updates.
          </p>
          <p>
          Another question we receive is why are specific version numbers
          not listed.
          Modern browsers release on a very frequent cadence, generally
          every few weeks.
          They also automatically update which means the user is no longer
          responsible or
          even aware in many cases that the browser has been updated.  As a
          result, the
          specific version numbers of browsers is less meaninful and more
          difficult to track.
