            Utility functions for announcing things in a page.
            This is used for accessibility where screen readers will read the
            message to the user as you call the announce functions. Behind the
            scenes we are using aria live regions. See {link} for additional
            references around this topic.
          </p>
          <p>
            You should use it carefully, if you add too many announcements it
            will
            definitely upset users. Few use cases where it is useful: page loads
            for single page apps, alerts, notifications, and things that are
            dynamically added to the page that users with disabilities will have
            issues locating.
