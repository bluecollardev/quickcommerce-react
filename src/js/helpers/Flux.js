/**
 * Borrowed from Dan Abramov's redux library, I just changed the formatting
 * I could have added the redux as a node package, but:
 * 1) I'm using the mobx-react Provider and injector HoC's to handle React's context and dependency injection
 * 2) I have no plans to use redux for anything in this project, and having it as a dep is a misnomer
